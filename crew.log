The trend in the data suggests that there is a positive correlation between a country's GDP and its population. This means that countries with larger populations tend to have higher levels of GDP. However, it is important to note that not all countries follow this trend, and other factors, such as government policies, natural resources, and geographical location, can influence a country's economic growth and development.
